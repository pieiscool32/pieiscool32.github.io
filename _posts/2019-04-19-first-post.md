Hey look, a blog.

The point of this blog is to give me a way to talk about anything I think is cool or want to rant about for a bit 
without bothering people in person.

A large potion of this blog will be dedicated to tech topics, but travel guides and credit card rambles as featured on
[the points guy](https://www.thepointsguy.com) are also fair game. While I don't travel every week to luxury destinations,
I do travel about once a quarter currently and have opinions that I'll randomly toss into blog posts.

But Chris, I hear you say, "why would I bother reading your incoherent ramblings when I could just read TPG or some other tech blog?"
To you dear reader, I have no answer for you.

### Background

A little bit about the basics of this blog as it stands today. I borrowed the boilerplate and basic template from
[amplify](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify) which brings [AMP](https://amp.dev) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and
therefore lets me write a blog using git on [GitHub](https://github.com/pieiscool32/pieiscool32.github.io). I spent a lot
of time debating the best way to go about writing this blog and finally decided that, since I am a developer, I want to
use a solution you won't find when searching for "how to start a blog" on Google.

I landed on Jekyll specifically because it gave me what I wanted: a way to write a blog in any arbitrary text editor on
any device that can use git. Hosting it on GitHub was an easy choice after that as they graciously let me or any user of
github host a page for free, with the added benefit that they also will compile the code for me.

Also, having a blog be git based as well as hosted using custom themes allows me to do things that are just not possible
with things like WordPress or Medium. For example, the bottom of this page originally had a Twitter link, but I don't use
Twitter, so I just made one for my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cmunte132) instead. It took me about 2 minutes to source
a suitable logo and plop it in to replace the Twitter one.

Another benefit is that I don't have to rely on whatever shitty web-editor that these sites make, I can write in anything
that supports markdown. The net result here is a ton of flexibility and convenience, making it more likely that I will stick
to this and make sure the site looks good.

### The Future

As for the future of the blog itself, only time can tell. My goal is to write at least one article a week about whatever
topic crosses my mind or piques my interest. I don't plan to write many introspective articles like this, but I make no promises.

I also don't plan to really advertise this blog, more just leave it for future employers or bored internet users to stumble across.
