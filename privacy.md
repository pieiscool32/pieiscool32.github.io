Google Analytics and Cloudflare are used on the site and they use cookies to collect statistics. Please see the privacy policies of these companies if you are concerned, or use tracking blockers. (I don't mind)

Cookies Used:
- _ga: Google Analytics cookie used to collect basic information to see how long you are on the site and what pages you visit.
- __cfduid: Cloudflare cookie used for applying security settings on a per-client basis.

Disqus is used on the site to promote conversation, you can post as a guest if you would like. Disqus does offer marketing and advertising products/options, but they have all been turned off. Any information you provide to Disqus that is not posted publicly with your comment is also hidden from me in their dashboard.

Advertising of any kind will not be used on the site, therefore tracking for advertising purposed will never be used. The only reason I use Google Analytics is to see how many people are looking at the site and how long they spend on it. All of the user tracking features in Google Analytics are turned off and will remain off because I do not care about who views the site.
