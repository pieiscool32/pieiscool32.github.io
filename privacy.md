Fathom Analytics and Cloudflare are used on the site and they use cookies to collect statistics. Please see the privacy policies of these companies if you are concerned, or use tracking blockers. (I don't mind)

Cookies Used:
- _fathom: Fathom cookie used to collect basic information to see how long you are on the site and what pages you visit.
- __cfduid: Cloudflare cookie used for applying security settings on a per-client basis.

Comments are provided through GitHub, any comments will be public and identifiable with the GitHub user who posted the comment. Anyone will be able to see this information, however, it is the responsibility of the user to set their account privacy.

Advertising of any kind will not be used on the site, therefore tracking for advertising purposed will never be used. The only reason I use Fathom Analytics is to see how many people are looking at the site and how long they spend on it. Fathom Analytics is very privacy fouced and does not collect any personally identifiable information.
