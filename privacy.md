Google Analytics is used on the site and they use cookies to collect statistics. I do not collect any data outside of what Google Analytics collects.

Disqus is also used on the site to promote conversation. I do not store any of the information you provide to them, I only can see what their dashboard allows me to see.

I am not going to sell any of the information collected by these websites and I will not send you emails or try to contact you outside of the Disqus comments.

Please see the Privacy statements of these companies if you are concerned or use tracking blockers. (I don't mind)

I also will never put ads on this site. The only reason I use Google Analytics is to see how many people are looking at the site and how long they spend on it.

Also, all of the advertising and audience analytics on Google Analytics is disabled and will never be enabled because I do not care about who is viewing the site.
